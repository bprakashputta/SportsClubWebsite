My B.Tech minor project code for the website of Sports Club, ABV-IIITM Gwalior. The zip file for the code can be downloaded from the drive link { https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KgQETz4ujMfC3P-6JDtnQx0b6G_3mLxC/view?usp=sharing}

-----------------------------------Firstly, to open the project files, I would suggest setting up MAMP server on the desktop.----------------------------

1.) For installing MAMP follow the link, (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEeHhQZ4cF0&t=442s) 
2.) After setting up the MAMP, you can run the server, copy the zip file to htdocs folder in the MAMP folder and extract.
3.) You will have to configure the MySQL server yourself and then it'd be ready for DB.
4.) And you can open the browser from MAMP application and view the website.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------Alternative-------------------------------------------------------------------

1.) If you just want to see the website and content. You can install Visual Studio Code, update PHP server plugin.
2.) After updating the PHP server, you can run the server to view the website. But, if we try this method we won't be able to view the Login page.
3.) This is because we haven't configured the database in visual studio. We would need to externally again connect a new database to run the application.
